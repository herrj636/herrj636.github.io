# Parallel Universes
### Assignment 1 - Juan Herrera

## Concept:
Halloween is my favorite holiday of the year, and that's not only because my birthday is in October. So, to get into the spooky holiday season, I chose a skull as the image that I'd like to use for this project. 

Coming from a design background, one of my strongest skills as a developer is my ability to levarge tools such as Adobe Creative Cloud. So, for this assignment I took the prompt to *create* the image in HTML, CSS and Javascript literally and chose to translate it into an inline SVG. This is easily done through Adobe Illustrator, which is able to output HTML-ready SVG files. Furthermore, creating different layers within Illustrator exports the SVG file with ID and class tags for each layer, this means that each element in the object is easily accessible through the DOM. This allowed me to write a simple javascript code that changes the color palette of the rings around the skull. **Click on the skull to see this interactivity work!**

I titled this project **Parallel Universes** because the prompt made me think of all the different ways one same object could be translated into HTML, CSS and Javascript. As next steps for this project I'd like for the button to spit out different a <div> with the same skull created in different ways.

## Next Steps:
- [] **Debug clearInterval so the skull animation doesn't get disrupted if the button is pressed more than one time.**
- [] **Would like to to create multiple versions i**
