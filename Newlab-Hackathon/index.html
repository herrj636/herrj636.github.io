				<h3>Project Overview</h3>
				<p>We believe there's a correlation between community behavior and their exposure to the virus. Therefore, we want to analyze the impact of the virus on these communities, and whether they are adhering to the social distancing rules. If not, we want to better understand the factors leading to non-compliance, which may include socio-economic status and race.</p>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>To answer these questions, we developed a dashboard able to cross reference multiple data sources and provide us with a detailed snapshot of the spread of the virus by zip code. Additionally, the dashboard allows us to visualize the relationship between the number of Covid-19 cases with the socio-economic status and predominant race of the community within that zip code. Lastly, we also cross reference turnstyle traffic on the subway stations by zip code, to see if there's a relationship between high subway usage and high amount of Covid-19 cases.</p>

				<h3>Our Process</h3>
				<p>We began our analysis by connecting the multiple data sources we wanted to use: confirmed cases of Covid-19, median income, race and subway usage by turnstyle traffic. We did this by assigning geolocation information as the common denominator that could weave a thread through these datapoints. We decided to segment our information by Zip code given that this information was readily available in the Covid-19 data and would allow us to achieve a high level of granularity for our research.</p>
				<h3>Potential Users</h3>
				<p>This dashboard could potentially be used by government and public health officials as a tool to explore and draw insights from a combination of socio-economic, epidemiological and mobility data. We believe that the insights it provides could be used to inform policy and allocate recources effectively to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially amongst its most vulnerable communities.<br><br>While we think government and health officials would find the greatest benefit from this tool — given the high detail of the data — we also believe that other researchers and the general public would be able to explore this tool and draw meaningful takeaways. We hope that other reseachers will be inspired by our work and use it to dig deeper into the data and find other useful insights. Lastly, we also believe that a general audience would benefit from our research by drawing awareness and building empathy towards the communities being hit the hardest by the virus. If we are able to apply solutions through a position of empathy, we will be able to mitigate the impact of the disease in the most vulnerable communities, and thus be able to defeat the virus much faster as a society in general.</p>
				<h3>Next Steps</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Connect a real-time data source able to continously add the latest information to our database.</li>
					<li>Explore the application of machine learning models to find patterns between several data points and create potential predictive or contact tracing models.</li>
