				<h3>Project Overview</h3>
				<p>We believe there's a correlation between community behavior and their exposure to the virus. Therefore, we want to analyze the impact of the virus on these communities, and whether they are adhering to the social distancing rules. If not, we want to better understand the factors leading to non-compliance, which may include socio-economic status and race.</p>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>To answer these questions, we developed a dashboard able to cross reference multiple data sources and provide us with a detailed snapshot of the spread of the virus by zip code. Additionally, the dashboard allows us to visualize the relationship between the number of Covid-19 cases with the socio-economic status and predominant race of the community within that zip code. Lastly, we also cross reference turnstyle traffic on the subway stations by zip code, to see if there's a relationship between high subway usage and high amount of Covid-19 cases.</p>

				<h3>Our Process</h3>
				<p>We began our analysis by connecting the multiple data sources we wanted to use: confirmed cases of Covid-19, median income, race and subway usage by turnstyle traffic. We did this by assigning geolocation information as the common denominator that could weave a thread through these datapoints. We decided to segment our information by Zip code given that this information was readily available in the Covid-19 data and would allow us to achieve a high level of granularity for our research.</p>
