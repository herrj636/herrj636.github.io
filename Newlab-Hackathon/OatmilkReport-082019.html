				<h3>Read the Quid Global Data <a href="https://i.quid.com/share/jzg0qjPPb4K5EWcfGPLoOmmM81AQeWKq?theme=dark">here</a></h3>
				<p>Discussions of the dairy labeling debate made up 14 percent of oat milk coverage in August. This was largely driven by the new plant-based/dairy milk hybrid products from Live Real Farm, but oat milk was also frequently mentioned in US-based coverage of a proposal from German legislators that would abolish the country’s VAT reduction on meat in the interest of meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. These pieces appear to have resonated strongly with consumers – Quid identified a very high level of social media traction for this cluster.</p>

				<p>Additionally, round-up pieces comparing various milk options was identified as a unique trend by Quid’s natural language processing for the first time. These round-ups have included oat milk since it began gaining traction in the US, but they have previously been identified as contributors to other discussion trends. Alt-milk round-ups being broken out as its own cluster could mean that oat milk has been included in more round-ups than in previous months, but based on the weekly coverage analyses, it is more likely that the cluster was identified as its own trend because the language used to discuss oat milk in relation to other milks has grown more consistent across outlets and journalists. </p>

				<p>Other major topics of media discussion were oat milk’s role in healthy eating (17%), in vegan or flexitarian eating (14%), and in seasonal food trends such as summer iced coffees and autumn pumpkin spice lattes (13%). Seasonal food trend pieces mentioning oat milk were particularly prevalent in top-tier consumer outlets, including Real Simple, Refinery29 and PureWow.</p>

				<p>On social media, August was a quiet month for discussions of oat milk. No new noteworthy trends emerged this month – positive sentiment continues to be tied to oat milk’s lower environmental impact and its taste and texture in coffee, while negative sentiment continues to be tied to the additional cost of substituting the product for dairy milk at cafes and its association with hipsters and millennials.</p>

				<p>Social media sentiment was slightly more favorable to oat milk (35.6%) than to almond milk (28.7%), but the US-based social media discussion of almond milk was 78% larger in volume than that of oat milk, and it reached 57% more social media users.</p>

				<p>The related companies most often mentioned in August were Oatly, Starbucks, Whole Foods, Califia Farms, Impossible Foods, Target, Costco, Kroger, Safeway, Live Real Farms, and Pacific Foods. Overall, Quid reported 177 stories covering oat milk in August.
